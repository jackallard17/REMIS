# REMIS
Source code for the Remarkably Efficient Mass Inoculation System (REMIS) by Fungaia, a peristaltic pump/injector system designed for large-scale mushroom cultivation via liquid culture.

## Installation
1. Clone this repo
2. Install the dependencies
3. Upload the sketch to the Arduino nano board, either using the Arduino IDE or the command line interface (CLI)

## I/O

This code is designed to run on an Arduino Nano board, connected to the following inputs:
- **Rotary encoder** for navigating the device's UI
- **Toggle switch** for using the pump's manual mode 
- **Button** which is used as a trigger for the inocculation gun 

And the following outputs:
- **LCD (I2C) display** for displaying the UI
- **Stepper Motor Driver** which takes the signals generated by the Arduino board and sends them to the pump
